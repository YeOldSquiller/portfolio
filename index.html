  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>My name is Tyler Dillinder and I am a 17 year old (2017) Gamer, Web Developer, Software and Hardware Engineer from Dearborn, Michigan. I currently live in Westland, Michigan and attend Wayne Memorial High school. In my Junior year I learned HTML, and this year I am learning Game Design (JavaScript). My desire to continue learning forms of code is strong and always want to learn more and more about HTML and JavaScript. I have been good with computers since I was 9, and always had a strong love for PC gaming. At the age of 16 I bought all the parts to have my very own computer built.</p>
