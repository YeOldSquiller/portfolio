<p><center>This is what the program looks like when it is first opened. As you can see there is a place for you to type where you guess your number. At the bottom there is your score, and it explains the rules with a little joke after that because we all know you aren't actually getting a prize.</center></p>

<p><center>When you guess the correct number it displays an image that is congradulating you for getting it correct. As you can tell it always adds one to your score when you get it correct and your score continues unless you refresh the page or reopen the program.</center></p>
<br><br><hr><br><br>
<img src="guessinggameloss.png" width="350" height="200" align="middle">
<p><center>When you lose it tells you the correct number and asks you to try again. It also tells you that you are too low or too high depending on the number you placed and what the random number is.</center></p>
<br><br><hr><br><br>
<img src="guessinggamecode1.png" width="500" height="75" align="middle">
<p><center>This code is actually the most important in the program. Without this code the random number you have to guess won't be displayed. So then at that point the same number would be guessed every time it is opened or there would be no number to guess.</center></p>
<br><br><hr><br><br>
<img src="guessinggamecode2.png" width="500" height="75" align="middle">
<p><center>The importance to this one is personally important because without this block of code you wouldn't know whether the number you're guessing is too high or too low from the random number. You would be sitting there for mulitple minutes just trying to figure out the number until you eventually get it making the game not so fun.</center></p>
