						The point in the game is to type in a random number between 1 and 100, if you're incorrect it tells you but if you're right then you receive a point and are told Congratulations. 
						The program was made within a group, there other creators names are, Tyler Brown, Chase Willis, Zakariya Abuzir, and Aric Kurash. 
						Since it was our first program/game created it was quite hard making it and took many days and attempts. 
						From the first program to this program we've added many things, such as a scoring system and being congradulated on your win. 
						A challenge that we experienced during the coding of this program was getting the score to add instead of resetting and the if, else statements were a bit challenging. 
						We overcame these difficulties by asking other students for help or reviewing the the w3schools JavaScript website.
