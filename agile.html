<p>Agile is being capable to create and respond to change in order to complete something. It is very important in the software development process because it divides work, and keeps everyone up to date on what's going on. It’s a successful way of teamwork. When trying to complete the MTAG development in the making, it was not as agile as it needed to be. But even saying that towards the end the group all got together and separated work by parts.</p>
<p>One value of agile that was used in creating the MTAG project was sharing information face-to-face to make disputing more efficient and effective. Like said there wasn’t much agile used until the end, and so towards the end is when parts were given out to make progress more efficient and effective. Each and every day we used this while in class there would be talking and discussing things about the MTAG project. It wasn’t exactly meeting every day, although everyone was able to talk to one another and hear what others had to say even if they weren’t directly in the group. It helped out group by keeping everyone on the same page or if someone needed help and a teammate knew how to do it, then they could ask for help or to switch jobs.</p>
<p>Another one from the 12 principles of agile used was business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. This was followed through because each day we would update Mr. Rychlicki with our game by either asking for 
help of some sort or just asking a simple question. Also some days he would ask where the project progression was so he could be updated. This helped the group by getting our project done a little quicker, by getting help when it was very needed and letting us know what to do. So if something was being done wrong Mr. Rychlicki would tell the group and the constant reminder of the deadline.</p>
<p>Working software is a primary measure of progress, especially if it’s efficient. Every time something was added and the program didn’t work, then something was wrong. Although sometimes the program will still work and it’s still done wrong, this is because the code doesn’t affect it but it isn’t working or displaying. The only way this could be fixed was by checking the error message in the browser.  It helped the group to know if the program was going to work or not, and if the program we were currently working on was having issues. Also if the end date was going to be met or not.</p>
<p>A value of agile that wasn’t used in the group that I wish would have been was regular intervals, the team reflects on how to be more efficient, then tunes and adjusts accordingly. This value in action would look like the group getting together at it’s regular face-to-face meetings and one of the ideas that come up is how to be more efficient and how this can be succeeded. Even though it is talked about, it should also be put into action, so someone should have the power of checking to make sure things have 
changed so that things move on a faster roll. This would help the group by getting more work done so there is no falling behind.</p>
<p>Agile wasn’t completely used in the MTAG project, although some were used such as separating work based on parts. During the daily and regular face-to-face meetings in class, the regular progress checks of the program by running it in chrome, or the daily question towards Mr. Rychlicki, also some of the time letting him know the progression. These all helped to realization of how much agile is actually used. Even though the group managed to get through without agile, it was still stressful and chaotic. Agile can be very useful for organization and separation of powers between work.</p>
